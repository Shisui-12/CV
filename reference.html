                    While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs.
                        "I
                        love
                        carrots"), <strong> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning!
                            This is
                            very dangerous.") Both <strong> and <em> can be nested to increase the relative degree of
                                    importance
                                    or stress emphasis, respectively.
